    - [ ] Text generation quality
        - [ ] Overeager LLM problem
            - [ ] Randomize the interests
            - [ ] Randomize the word list
        - [ ] Repetitions of the same topic
            - [ ] Series, for a given narrow topic, save the info the user has been exposed to, and feed it into the prompt for continuation, not repetition
        - [ ] Consider if and when to switch to prompting in the target language, and not the interface one
    - [ ] Better user interests system
    - [ ] Add titles for text in LLM generation and Frontend
    - [ ] Improve the sentence split for translations - combine short sentences, and split long ones
        - [ ] At the same time keep the lookup by actual sentences, should be straightforward
    - [ ] LLM Backend
        - [ ] Test out for openrouter rate limits - right now everything runs on one API key
        - [ ] Allow for defining providers other than openrouter
        - [ ] Configure the model choice for the text generation
- [ ] Testing
    - [ ] Fixed sample of fake-llm inputs to avoid delays each time and ensure the same quality while developing
    - [ ] Simple pytest implementation
- [ ] Learning Systems
    - [ ] SRS logic
        - [ ] Test out the basic SRS logic
        - [ ] Add sentence/paragraph/text translations into the calculation
        - [ ] Improve the logic for separating lemma vs form issues for fusional languages for scoring
    - [ ] Grammar
        - [ ] Compile the list of grammar patterns for Chinese
        - [ ] Figure out prompting for LLMs to use given grammar patterns in a sentence
        - [ ] Come up with a scoring systems for grammar patterns
        - [ ] Hook up the word, sentence, paragraph and text lookups to updates for the scoring system
- [ ] Core Functionality
    - [ ] Add sentence and paragraph translations
        - [x] Basic functionality on rightclick
            - [x] Basic design implementation
            - [x] Fix the bugs so that it actually works
                - [x] Seems like sentence translation doesn't work on parsed and highlighted (clickable) words specifically
        - [x] Move the lookup from a request to local storage, like for words
        - [x] Coherent colors and design
        - [ ] Find the top line of the given text chunk, and display above it, irregardless of cursor position
    - [ ] Finish and test the word list viewer
    - [ ] Add overall progress estimations and other eye candy in stats
        - [ ] Configure the mechanisms for estimating language progress
        - [ ] -//- for learned words, how to split the quantitative data for them into discrete categories
        - [ ] UI for that
- [ ] UX
    - [x] URGENT - fix the bug of shifted word tokenization
    - [x] Remove the login and sign up delay
    - [x] TODO Fix the "Hide translation" not working
    - [x] Move the <hr> above the translation into the translated text div
    - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts and making them redefinable in settings
    - [ ] BYOK in user settings
    - [ ] Model and provide choice in user settings
- [ ] UI & Theming
    - [ ] Add a 404 page
    - [ ] Add dark theme
    - [ ] Add a theme manager - possibility for user defined themes for each class
        - [ ] Ensure each item on the screen has a class for theme manager to work
- [ ] Come up with a project name and branding
- [ ] Deployment & User Management
    - [ ] Add tiers
        - [ ] Make the tiers definable on signup for starters
    - [ ] Admin panel for managing existing users and their tiers
    - [ ] Think about rate limits and permissions for different tiers
    - [ ] Add Sign in with Google
        - [ ] Last used (in local storage or something)
    - [ ] Check the error messages in the UI on 409, 422, etc
- [ ] Gamification
    - [ ] Max's idea - adapt the progression to the style of the user
    - [ ] -//- Choose your own adventure RPG
