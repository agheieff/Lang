- add a list of "all words" for a language, separate from a list of "learned/learning words"
- switch between profiles for a user, with one profile active at a time (served server-side)
- language choice on signup and automatic profile creation with that
- Headline generation - the user chooses a text that gets generated
- topic preferences based on user text choice - also think about how to avoid local minima
- Remove the target language parameter, make it a detail of the profile. One profile = one source and one target language
- improve the translation popup - check what to do with tokens not in dict, and punctuation
- actually hook up openrouter
- openrouter library - rework the model list into a database that can be easily updated by the app and integration with the ui lib
- when server is off, the tokenizer fails in a not-nice way - entire sentences as a token, not critical, but could be handled better
