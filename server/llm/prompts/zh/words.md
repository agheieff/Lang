Now please translate the individual words from the text into English. Go over all the words from the text in order, not skipping anything, and return valid json - a single array of all the words. Each word should be an object with the following four keys:
- word – the original Chinese character(s)
- pinyin – the pinyin with diacritics (e.g. "tiānqì")
- translation – the most context-appropriate English gloss for this word
- pos – the part-of-speech label (e.g. "NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ", "PART", etc.)

Tokenize the text into the smallest meaningful units (words, not individual characters unless they are single-character words).
Preserve the original order; the array must map one-to-one with the token sequence. Skip any punctuation you encounter.

Here's an example for how the first sentence from the text from before would be done:

[
    {
        "word": "今天",
        "pinyin": "jīntiān",
        "translation": "today",
        "pos": "NOUN"
    },
    {
        "word": "天气",
        "pinyin": "tiānqì",
        "translation": "weather",
        "pos": "NOUN"
    },
    {
        "word": "很",
        "pinyin": "hěn",
        "translation": "very",
        "pos": "ADV"
    },
    {
        "word": "好",
        "pinyin": "hǎo",
        "translation": "good",
        "pos": "ADJ"
    },
    {
        "word": "阳光",
        "pinyin": "yáng guāng",
        "translation": "sunshine",
        "pos": "NOUN"
    },
    {
        "word": "明媚",
        "pinyin": "míng mèi",
        "translation": "bright and beautiful",
        "pos": "ADJ"
    },
]
