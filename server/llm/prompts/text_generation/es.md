**CRITICAL: The text MUST be between {length} and {length_plus_100} words in length.** This is a strict requirement, not a suggestion.

Try to include at least some of the following words in the text: {include_words}. Gently reinforce target words in context and keep the language natural and engaging.
Separate paragraphs with double newlines (\n\n).
{topic_line}
Please output the title and text in pipe-separated CSV format with a header row:

word|translation|pos|lemma
ruf...an|call|VERB|anrufen
